Iris Classification using Logistic Regression
Overview
This project aims to classify the species of iris flowers using logistic regression. We will use the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning, to train a logistic regression model to classify iris species based on their features.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with the following features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
Species (target variable with three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica)
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
